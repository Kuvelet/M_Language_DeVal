# Inventory Devaluation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the financial impact of a recent price discount on a bulk of auto parts in the company's catalog. The company has agreements with its customers that allow them to return purchased items, and as a result, customers are requesting compensation due to the devaluation of their inventory. To assess the devaluation, we processed the customer-shared inventory data, which consists of the discounted parts, and used M language to evaluate the financial loss caused by the price reductions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The customers provided their inventory data, listing parts that were affected by the price discount. The Company has its own Sales Data.
2. **Data Processing**: Using Power Query M language, the project:
   - Extracts relevant data from the provided inventory.
   - Matches it with the new discounted prices.
   - Computes the devaluation by comparing previous prices with the new ones.
3. **Analysis & Reporting**:
   - The devaluation per part is calculated.
   - Aggregated reports show total financial impact per customer.
   - Visual insights are generated where applicable.

## Technologies Used
- **Power Query (M Language)**: For data transformation and analysis.
- **Excel / Power BI**: To visualize and report findings.
- **SQL (Optional)**: If needed, for querying historical sales and price data.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Power Query script in Power BI or Excel.
3. Duplicate the steps for your own needs

## Expected Outcome
- A clear summary of financial impact per customer.
- A breakdown of inventory devaluation per part.
- A report to assist in decision-making regarding customer compensation claims.

## Contribution & Future Improvements
- Automating data extraction and integration with real-time price updates.
- Expanding the scope to predict future devaluation risks.
